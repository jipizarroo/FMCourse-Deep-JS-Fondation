# Fundamental objects

Are they types?? Sort off but not really.\
\
\* This is something that the speaker said should not be used, but should be understood. \*&#x20;

Example: \
Use new:

* Object()
* Array()
* Function()
* Date()
* RegExp()
* Error()

Don't use new:

* String()
* Number()
* Boolean()

Why should we use `new Date()`? Because there are no Date literals, we must create a new one, every time we use it.
